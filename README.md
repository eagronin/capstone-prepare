# Data Exploration

## Overview
This section explores the data used for completing the final project of the Big Data Specialization by University of California San Diego on Coursera. The project focuses on developing recommendations for increasing revenue in a fictitious online game called "Catch the Pink Flamingo". 

The data for the project consists of 8 files with data on in-app purchases, ad clicks and game-specific information as well as 6 files with chat data.  The data were downloaded from the Coursera website.  All the data for the project were generated by a development team of data scientists.  The data were designed to simulate many aspects of game play and in-game user activity.  

The project entails classification analysis by fitting a decision tree and cluster analysis using k-means.  It also uses graph analytics to identify the chattiest users / teams, longest conversations and active user groups. 

The analysis in this project was performed using Python, Spark, KNIME and Neo4j.

This section is organized as follows:

**Introduction**<br/>
**Description of Catch The Pink Flamingo Online Game**<br/>
**Overview of the Catch the Pink Flamingo Data Model**<br/>
- Gameplay<br/>
- Simulation Overview<br/>
- General User Sessions and Team-assignments<br/>
- Leveling Up and More on User Sessions<br/>

**Data Set Overview**<br/>
- Data on In-App Purchases, Ad Clicks and Game-Specific Information<br/>
- Schema of the Graph Database for Chats<br/>

The analysis is described in the [next section](https://eagronin.github.io/capstone-prepare/).

# Preliminary Data Exploration

As a first step, we load the file `buy-clicks.csv` into Splunk and output several summary ststistics and charts to understand the data.  We find that the total amount spent on buying in-app purchase items is $21,407, while the number of unique items available to be purchased is 6.  

Below is a histogram showing how many times each item is purchased:

**insert histogram**

We can see on the chart below how much money was made from each item:

**insert histogram**

We note that the revenue was calculated as the sum of prices for each item multiplied by 2% which is the amount that Eglence, Inc. earns for each item sold.

We then filter the data to plot the total amount of money spent by the top ten users (ranked by how much money they spent):

The following table shows the user id, platform, and hit-ratio percentage for the top three buying users:

Rank | User Id | Platform | Hit-Ratio (%)
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 2229 | iphone | 11.6%
2 | 12 | iphone | 13.1%
3 | 471 | iphone | 14.5%
